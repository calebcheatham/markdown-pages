## My Favorite <mark>Golf Clubs</mark>

1. **Driver** (_Sim2 Max_)
    + Hitting a good drive is possibly the best feeling on a golf course,<br>The feeling of watching your drive fly straight down the fairway is unmatched

2. **Sand Wedge** (_Volkey SM10_)
    - There are not many things more visually satisfying things then puring a 100 yard wedge shot<br>and watching it land and spin on the green
